        <h2>Simultaneous Global Streaming Launches</h2>
        <p>
          In Q4 2019 and Q1 2020, two major Hollywood studios launched their
          respective globally-competitive streaming services in dozens of
          international markets.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          Almost simultaneously, both studios asked The Sherlock Company to
          translate, localize and deliver all of their brand and title-specific
          marketing, social media and creative assets for their launches.{" "}
        </p>

        <h3>Sherlock Solution</h3>
        <p>
          The automation and data dashboard capabilities of Sherlock Pipeline
          prioritized decision-making to ensure laser-focus on delayed assets.{" "}
        </p>

        <h3>The result</h3>
        <p>
          Picture-perfect delivery of localized assets for all markets with no
          delayed launch dates. Sherlock continues to support the ongoing
          international expansion of both platforms.{" "}

        <h2>Multi-Vendor Management for a Mega Catalog Project</h2>
        <p>
          Multiple global releases of movies and TV shows over decades across
          different business models usually results in a decentralized,
          incomplete and non-uniform library of localized marketing and creative
          assets.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          A major Hollywood studio decided to standardize the key-art of more
          than 2,500 titles across an entire region with 20 languages, many
          complex.{" "}
        </p>

        <h3>Sherlock Solution</h3>
        <p>
          The Sherlock Company was selected to oversee the work of four vendors,
          with Sherlock Pipeline used to centralize the process of receiving,
          revising, QCing and delivering localized assets.{" "}
        </p>

        <h3>The result</h3>
        <p>
          More than 300,000 localized assets delivered on-schedule, prompting
          the client to implement the same project in other regions.

        <h2>Metadata Cleanup for Prestigious Acquired Library</h2>
        <p>
          A big name independent film catalog changed home entertainment
          distributors three times before being acquired by a major Hollywood
          studio.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          The Sherlock Company was asked to audit, restore and standardize the
          metadata for the portfolio’s top-performing titles, including the
          artwork, local title and ratings in 26 countries and 30 languages.
        </p>

        <h3>Sherlock Solution</h3>
        <p>
          The Sherlock Metadata Aggregator Tool and local-market sources were
          used to find official metadata and create localized artwork where gaps
          existed, normalizing the portfolio.
        </p>

        <h3>The result</h3>
        <p>
          Over 10,000 localized data points and territory-specific assets were
          delivered in less than 90 days, restoring the portfolio’s ability to
          generate revenue on transactional and streaming platforms worldwide.
